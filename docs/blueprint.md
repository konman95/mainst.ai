# Main St AI - Power Architecture Blueprint

## Core Identity (Non-Negotiable)
Main St AI is not a tool. Main St AI is a business operator.
Every feature must reduce owner responsibility, not add options.

## The Decision Core (The Brain)
Centralized system that decides what to do, whether to do it, and how safely.
All actions pass through it: chat replies, owner cover, follow-ups, escalations.
Every decision answers:
1) What is the goal?
2) What is the risk?
3) What authority do I have?
4) What context do I need?
5) What is the safest acceptable action?
6) What happens if I am wrong?

## Business Memory System (Primary Moat)
Layered memory:
1) Business facts: services, hours, pricing rules, policies, boundaries.
2) People memory: history, preferences, friction patterns, VIP vs high-risk.
3) Interaction memory: conversations, follow-ups, escalations.
4) Decision memory: what AI did, why, approved or overridden.
5) Outcome memory: conversion, satisfaction, intervention required.
Memory turns the system from reactive into experienced.

## Owner Cover Mode (Delegation Engine)
Controlled responsibility transfer.
Modes:
- Off: observe only.
- Monitor: draft + queue.
- Auto-Send: act within guardrails.
Authority is explicit: can do, must ask, never do.

## Guardrails (Trust Infrastructure)
Guardrails enable delegation:
- Confidence thresholds
- Topic restrictions
- Money sensitivity
- Complaint escalation
- Quiet hours
- Do-not-touch categories

## Action Queue + Approval Flow
Autonomy is reviewable and reversible.
Every action is sent, queued, or blocked.
Queued actions show draft response, reasoning, confidence, and risk flags.

## Audit Log (Permanent Accountability)
Every AI action is logged:
- Input
- Interpretation
- Decision path
- Final action
- Outcome
This is the trust engine and legal safety net.

## Outcome-Driven Intelligence
Track results: responses, conversions, resolutions, owner intervention.
Feed back into confidence, escalation thresholds, follow-up timing, phrasing.

## Background Intelligence
Silent power:
- Unanswered messages
- Stalled leads
- Repeated questions
- Policy conflicts
- Operational anomalies

## Unified Channel Architecture
All channels feed the same brain: web chat, email, SMS, future voice.
Each channel adds signal, not complexity.

## Visibility of Value (Retention Engine)
Show outcomes constantly:
- AI handled X interactions
- AI saved Y minutes
- AI prevented Z escalations

## Power Roadmap (Execution Order)
Phase 1: Control (Decision Core, Owner Cover, Guardrails, Audit Log, Smart Chat)
Phase 2: Memory (Decision memory, outcomes, contact intelligence)
Phase 3: Autonomy (Background actions, proactive follow-ups)
Phase 4: Expansion (Voice, billing, scheduling, integrations)

## North Star
Does this increase the AI's ability to run the business without the owner present?
If yes, build. If no, reject.
